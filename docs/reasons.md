Why Use  `hybracter`
---------
1. If you want the best possible _automated_ long read only or hybrid bacterial isolate genome assembly.
  * Hybracter hybrid is more accurate than Unicycler, much faster and just as easy to run. 
  * Hybracter long _solves_ the long-read only plasmid assembly problem and produces the most accurate automated chromosome assembly.
2. If you need to assemble many (e.g. 10+) bacterial isolates as efficiently as possible.
  * I wrote it originally because I needed to assembly more than 200 long-read sequenced isolates.
3. If you want all information about from assembly pipeline such as whether your polishing probably improved the genome, whether your assembly was likely complete, and how many plasmids you probably assembled.
